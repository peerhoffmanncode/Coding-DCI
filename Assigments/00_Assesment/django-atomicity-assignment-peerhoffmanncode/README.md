Create a django project, provide the necessary model and template files to get a simple transfer application working between 2 customers.

- Always blacken your files (i.e. Use PEP8 rules where possible).
- If you install any libraries, django included, you may have to create a requirements file for other developers to work with your code such as your teacher.
- Only 1 model is sufficient for this project, it is already too complicated with Django and its rules.

Harder and optional task
========================
- Please write tests (the django way).
