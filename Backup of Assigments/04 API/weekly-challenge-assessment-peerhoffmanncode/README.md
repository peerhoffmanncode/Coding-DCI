## Task 1

Create a script that loops through all the Pokemons and extracts their names

Step 1
- go through a list of all Pokemons

URL for the list of pokemons can be found here: `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon`. Use the `next` key in dictionary to access the next page 
of the API. Perform this recursively.

- Step 2
Extract the name of the Pokemon and write it to a file.

## Task 2

- Instead of writing to a file, store this data in a database

⚠️ You may need to learn more about databases on your own and perhaps install a library from Python to insert data into a database.
