# Task - Matrix mean

You are given a two dimensional list of numbers. Calculate the mean of those numbers by implementing a `mean` method that takes a list as an argument.

## Input:

```
numbers = [[5, 6, 3], [8, 3, 1], [9, 10, 4], [8, 4, 2]]
```

## Output:

```
> mean(numbers)

[19, 65, 23, 90]
```
