# Task - List intersection

You are given two lists with an unknown amount of elements. Both of those lists may have some elements in common. Implement a method `intersection` that takes those two lists as arguments and returns a third list only with the elements they have in common.

## Input:

```
list_1 = [15, 9, 10, 56, 23, 78, 5, 4, 9]
list_2 = [9, 4, 5, 36, 47, 26, 10, 45, 87]
```

## Output:

```
> intersection(list_1, list_2)

[9, 10, 4, 5]
```
