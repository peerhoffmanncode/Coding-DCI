# Task - Combine lists into a dict

You are given two lists. One with color names (`['red', 'green', 'blue']`) and the other one with their RGB hex value (`['#FF0000','#00FF00', '#0000FF']`). Create a combined dict `colors` from those two lists so that for example printing `colors['green']` shows `#008000` on the screen.

## Input:

```
color_names = ['red', 'green', 'blue']
color_hex = ['#FF0000','#00FF00', '#0000FF']
```

## Output:

```
{
  'blue': '#0000FF', 
  'green': '#00FF00', 
  'red': '#FF0000'
}
```
