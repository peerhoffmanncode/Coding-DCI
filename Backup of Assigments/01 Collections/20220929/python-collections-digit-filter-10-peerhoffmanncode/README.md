# Task - Filter lists

You are given a list of strings. Some of those strings may contain integers, for example `Digital Car33r Institute`. Implement a method `digit_filter` that takes a list of strings as an argument and only returns those strings that don't contain a number.

## Input:

```
l33t = ['Digital Car33r Institute', 'DCI', 'Digital', 'Career', 'Inst1tut3']
```

## Output:

```
> digit_filter(l33t)

['DCI', 'Digital', 'Career']
```
