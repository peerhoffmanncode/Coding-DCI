"""
Design an function called `save()`.

The save method that takes in a dictionary with 2 key/value pairs:
{"first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe"}

Recall that to insert data, the following is the code you
would use:

INSERT INTO humans (first_name, last_name) values('john', 'doe');

For example:

return_value = save('John', 'Doe')
print(return_value)
>>> { "first_name": "John", "last_name": "Doe" }

def save(dictionary):
    """
    Save first_name and last_name to the database and return a dictionary

    # cur is a cursor, an object through which you can perform some database actions
    connection, cur = connect_db()

    # Adding "Sr." to the name
    dictionary["last_name"] += " Sr."

    print(id, first_name, last_name)
    save_to_db(connection)
    close_connection(connection, cur)
