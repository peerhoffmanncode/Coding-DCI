# Exercise
# To get a total, we have a function that looks like this,
# rewrite (refactor) the function to use a while loop

def total_list_for(lst):
    total = 0
    for item in lst:
        total += item
    return total

def total_list_while(lst):
    index = result = 0
    while index <= len(lst) -1:
        result += lst[index]
        index += 1
    return result

# test case
print(total_list_for([1,2,3]))   # answer is 6

print(total_list_while([1,2,3]))   # answer is 6
print(total_list_while([3,3,3])) # answer should be 9
print(total_list_while([]))   # answer is 0
