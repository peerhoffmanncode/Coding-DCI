Some helpful instructions:

In this exercise, explore the use of iPython. A tool for interactive computing.

Start the iPython shell by typing the following command:

```console
ipython
```

You can load scripts in the currently working directory by:

```console
%load <name of file>.py
```

Sometimes when code is loaded you have to press the `enter` key two times for it to be reflected.
