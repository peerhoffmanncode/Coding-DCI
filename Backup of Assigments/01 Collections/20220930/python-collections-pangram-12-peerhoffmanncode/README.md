# Task - Pangram

Pangrams are sentences (i.e. strings) that contain all characters of the alphabet. Implement a method `is_pangram` that takes one argument as input and checks if the given string is a pangram and then returns the result as a boolean value.

## Examples:

```
'Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex.'
'Glib jocks quiz nymph to vex dwarf.'
'Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.
'How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!'
'The five boxing wizards jump quickly.'
'Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.'
'Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.'
```
